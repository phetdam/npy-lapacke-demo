npy_openblas_demo
=================

A tiny Python package demonstrating calls into OpenBLAS__ from the
`NumPy C API`__.

Intended as an example of how to perform linear algebra with NumPy arrays
directly with OpenBLAS routines in C extension modules, which is clearly
important in the context of numerical computing.
