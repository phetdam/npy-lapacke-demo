npy_openblas_demo
=================

A tiny Python package demonstrating calls into OpenBLAS__ from the
`NumPy C API`__.

Intended as an example of how to operate on NumPy arrays with OpenBLAS routines
in C extension modules, an use case that would be common in C extension modules
performing computations requiring linear algebra routines with NumPy arrays.
